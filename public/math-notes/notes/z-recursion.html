<h2>What is recursion?</h2>
<p>To put simply, recursion is solving a problem referring to itself. It depends on smaller pieces of the same problem  in order to solve the
main problem. To be more concrete, recursive problems repeatedly calls itself, dividing the main problem into many subproblems of itself.
For example, finding the factorial of a number can be done recursively.</p>

<p>Finding the factorial requires it to repeatedly multiply its current value with the next number. The self-referential part of the factorial
problem is is the product.</p>

<h2>When do I use recursion?</h2>
<p>There are a couple of cases where recursion is useful: </p>
<ul>
    <li>When you want to find every possible solution of a problem.</li>
    <li>The object in the problem is defined recursively, like a tree or a graph data structure.</li>
</ul>
