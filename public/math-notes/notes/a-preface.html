<h1>Preface</h1>
When I was solving a computer science interview problem, I came to realize something quite horrific. Not only was I not able to come up with a proof for my solution, I 
was not even able to come up with a statement to prove. <br />
<br />
Alan Turing is one of my heroes, and I remember he stated something along the lines of, computer scientists should be mathematicians and highly disciplined. Sure, I am still 
developing self-discipline, but my mathematics ability matched that of a high schooler. If I landed a software engineering job, and I was unable to prove my own algorithms, what 
kind of software engineer would I be? Definitely not one that deserves respect. For Mr. Turing, I'll try to do him proud and spend at least an hour a day studying Mathematics. <br />
<br />
I believe the best way for me to maximize my time studying while still acquiring solid fundamentals is by studying math proofs. I am already somewhat familiar with all the maths 
leading up to vector calculus/linear algebra. Although I am nowhere near mastering all those topics, I think I just need to understand the fundamentals of proofs. I will start with 
studying page by page the introductory book "The Art of Proof: Basic Training for Deeper Mathematics" by Beck Matthias and Ross Geoghegan. After, I will study 
"Linear Algebra as an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics" by Anne Schilling, Bruno Nachtergaele, and Isaiah Lankham. Both these texts are relatively short, 200-300 pages. I should be 
relatively comfortable with the basics of mathematics after studying these books. <br />
<br />
There are many problems involved with documenting my studies. The main problem is when I study, I write down important facts and write proofs on paper. If I document all my writings, the 
time it would take to type math notation would be just as time consuming as studying the material itself. Therefore, i'm sad to say that I will be documenting only the important 
notes I jot down in my primary notebook. This means nothing from my scratchpad, including all my personal proofs. <br />
<br />
Besides mindlessly copying text directly from textboox with some occasional personal thoughts, I will also add my own "material". Something along the lines of a compilation of thoughts 
and ideas about a subject I've gathered mostly from the internet. It won't be the least bit professional as math texts are, and most likely won't be as accurate and precise as well. 
However, I think this is a good way to express my thoughts as a math student, and perhaps even improve my writing skills as well.
